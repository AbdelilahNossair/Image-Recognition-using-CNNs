# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
## Overview
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset includes 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.). The script employs TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the CNN. The model includes multiple layers: convolutional layers for feature extraction, max pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, dense layers for decision making, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, faces, and scenes. They learn directly from the data, optimizing their internals to capture the best features and structures for the problem at hand.

The architecture of a CNN typically involves a series of convolutional and pooling layers that extract features from images, followed by fully connected layers that use these features for classifying the images into their respective categories.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model built for the CIFAR-10 classification consists of the following layers:
- **Conv2D Layers:** Convolutional layers that will extract features from the input images.
- **MaxPooling2D Layers:** Pooling layers that reduce the dimensions of the feature maps, thus reducing the number of parameters to learn.
- **Flatten Layer:** A layer that flattens the input making it possible to connect to dense layers.
- **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers that predict the class of the image based on the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers.
- **Dropout Layer:** A layer that helps prevent overfitting in the model by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- **TensorFlow:** An end-to-end open source platform for machine learning that facilitates building and training neural networks.
- **NumPy:** A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **Matplotlib:** A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **scikit-learn:** A machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machines, random forests, and k-neighbours, and also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
- **Seaborn:** A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.



## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with TensorFlow and other required libraries using the following command

```
4. The script will train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate it on the test set.

## Results

After training, the model achieves an accuracy score on the test set. This score reflects how well the model has learned to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
