# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes, each representing different objects such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc. The notebook uses TensorFlow and Keras to construct and train the CNN, exploring various layers and techniques fundamental to modern image classification tasks.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of neural network model designed for processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as images. CNNs are particularly effective for image recognition tasks because they can develop an internal representation of a two-dimensional image. This allows them to learn location-invariant features, making them powerful for image classification.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model for CIFAR-10 classification in this notebook includes:
- **Conv2D Layers:** These layers perform the convolution operation, extracting features from the input images.
- **MaxPooling2D Layers:** These layers reduce the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the input volumes, helping to decrease the computational load, memory usage, and the number of parameters.
- **Flatten Layer:** This layer flattens the input to a one-dimensional array to prepare it for input into the dense layers.
- **Dense Layers (Fully Connected Layers):** These layers compute the class scores, producing the final classification output.
- **Dropout Layer:** This layer randomly drops units (along with their connections) during the training process to prevent overfitting.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed to run this notebook:

- **TensorFlow:** Provides the backend for Keras and tools for machine learning workflows.
- **NumPy:** Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions.
